## üíì Heart Rate Monitor ‚Äì Pure Digital Logic Implementation

This project demonstrates a **heart rate monitoring system** built **entirely using digital electronics components** such as logic gates, flip-flops, comparators, and 7-segment display ICs ‚Äî with **no microcontroller, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or programmable logic** involved. It showcases how fundamental principles of digital electronics can be applied to create a functional and educational biomedical device.

### üß† Project Overview

The Heart Rate Monitor works by detecting the user's heartbeat using a basic **infrared-based photoplethysmography (PPG) technique**. Blood flow changes in the fingertip cause variations in light absorption, which are captured as analog pulses. These pulses are processed through comparators and converted into clean digital signals.

Using only **digital logic ICs**, the system counts the number of heartbeats in a fixed time interval and then calculates the **beats per minute (BPM)**. The resulting BPM value is displayed using **7-segment displays** to give a real-time readout of the user‚Äôs heart rate.

| **Binary Counter ICs (e.g., 74LS90 / 74LS93)**                  | Counts the number of heartbeats in a predefined time window (e.g., over 6 or 10 seconds).                              |
| **AND, OR, NOT, XOR Gates (74LS Series)**                       | Implements **control logic** for counting, reset, gating, and display enable functions.                                |

### ‚è±Ô∏è How the Timing Works:

* Count the number of digital pulses (heartbeats) in a fixed time window (e.g., 10 seconds).
* Multiply the count by 6 to approximate BPM.
* Alternatively, adjust clock frequency and counters to scale the output automatically to BPM.
